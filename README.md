## Project Overview
This notebook explores a real estate dataset, performing data cleaning, visualization, and statistical analysis. The EDA helps to understand the key factors affecting real estate prices and trends in the market.

## Installation
To run this project, you need Python 3.x and the following libraries:
- pandas
- numpy
- seaborn
- matplotlib

You can install the dependencies using:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy seaborn matplotlib
```

## Usage
1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/real-estate-eda.git
    cd real-estate-eda
    ```
2. Open the Jupyter notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook "realstate project EDA.ipynb"
    ```
3. Run the cells to reproduce the analysis and visualizations.
